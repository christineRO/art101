			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
                    <!--PUT DOWN THE PROBLEMS THAT AROSE-->
                    <p>Some problems that arose were being able to sort in the bonus task. I found it a bit challenging, but worth my while. WesBot really helped me out, and I was able to understand what was happenning in the code after taking a look at it!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
                    <!--REFLECT ON THE ASSIGNMENT-->
                    <p>Reflecting on this assignment, I thought that this was probably the first actually-a-bit-challenging (bonus) task to complete. I enjoyed being tested like this.</p>
