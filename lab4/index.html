			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>I guess a problem that arose was me trying to find out using js on vs. But I've figured it out! And in this class, I am relearning the things that I have long forgotten in high school.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>Pseudocode is very useful in pouring out ideas! I thought that it was very useful, and went really well. I put energetic energy into this assignment.</p>
