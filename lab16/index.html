                    <!--PUT DOWN THE PROBLEMS THAT AROSE-->
                    <p>A problem that I had with the lab involved CORs. The errors that popped up with me a bit reluctant to know if I did the lab right, but with the CORS unblocker I was able to see what was actually happening to the webpage.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
                    <!--REFLECT ON THE ASSIGNMENT-->
                    <p>I think that WesBot and Wes are a great part of why I understand a lot of the material. Me being able to see, work, understand, and inquire things about a lab have made me open to a whole lot more understanding on how certain things work.</p>
