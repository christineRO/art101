					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them?</p>
					<div class="myAnswer">
						<p>The only problems that arose, for me personally, was linking with the CSS page. The site.css overwrote the homepage.css and that's where things got a bit confusing for me. I solved them by realizing that site.css overwrote homepage.css and I fixed it!</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<div class="myAnswer">
						<p>I liked the challenge. Coding is like hitting a brick wall until it breaks sometimes, then realizing there was a door right next to that brick wall.</p>
