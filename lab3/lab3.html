            <h1>Lab 3: Structure and File Transfer</h1>
            <p>This lab was all about demonstrating learning how to create new pages and links to files.</p>

            <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
            <p>Some of the challenges that came up for me were being able to put the image into the files. I had to navigate where the image folder was.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>In the end, I was able to do it properly!</p>
