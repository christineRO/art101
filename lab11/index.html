                    <!--PUT DOWN THE PROBLEMS THAT AROSE-->
                    <p>I think that the hardest part about this is making sure that I'm coding 'correctly'. Like making sure I'm putting the correct annotations, calling the right classes, etc. That was the main problem that I have been and am running into in this lab, so after 30 minutes of frustration and a break I realized I forgot a # somewhere in my jQuery calls.</p>
